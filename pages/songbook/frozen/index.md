Do you wanna build a snowman?  
Come on let's go and play  
I never see you anymore come out the door it's like you've gone away  
We used to be best buddies but now we're not, I wish you would tell me why!  
Do you wanna build a snowman, it doesn't have to be a snowman!  
(Go away Anna!) Ok bye!  

Do you wanna build a snowman or ride are bikes around the halls?  
I think some company is overdue I've started talking to the pictures on the walls.  
(Hang in there jones!)  
It gets a little lonely, all these empty rooms  
Just watching the hours tick by!!!  
(Tik tok tik tok tik tok tik tok)  

Elsa, please I know your in there  
people are asking where you been they say have courage and I'm trying to  
I'm right out here for you just let me in!!!  
We only have eachother  
It's just you and me   
What are we going to do?  
Do you wanna build a snowman?

The snow glows white on the mountain tonight  
Not a footprint to be seen  
A kingdom of isolation  
And it looks like I'm the queen  

The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside  
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried!  

Don't let them in, don't let them see  
Be the good girl you always have to be  
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know  
Well, now they know!  

Let it go, let it go  
Can't hold it back anymore  
Let it go, let it go  
Turn away and slam the door!  

I don't care  
What they're going to say  
Let the storm rage on  
The cold never bothered me anyway!  

It's funny how some distance  
Makes everything seem small  
And the fears that once controlled me  
Can't get to me at all!  

It's time to see what I can do  
To test the limits and break through  
No right, no wrong, no rules for me I'm free!  

Let it go, let it go  
I am one with the wind and sky  
Let it go, let it go  
You'll never see me cry!  

Here I stand  
And here I'll stay  
Let the storm rage on!  

My power flurries through the air into the ground  
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around  
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast  
I'm never going back  
The past is in the past!  

Let it go, let it go  
And I'll rise like the break of dawn  
Let it go, let it go  
That perfect girl is gone!  

Here I stand  
In the light of day  
Let the storm rage on  
The cold never bothered me anyway!
