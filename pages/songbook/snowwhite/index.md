With a smile and a song  
Life is just like a bright sunny day  
Your cares fade away  
And your heart is young  

With a smile and a song  
All the world seems to waken anew  
Rejoicing with you  
As the song is sung  

There's no use in grumbling  
When the raindrops come tumbling  
Remember, you're the one  
Who can fill the world with sunshine  

When you smile and you sing  
Everything is in tune and it's spring  
And life flows along  
With a smile and a song

We dig dig dig dig dig dig dig in our mine the whole day through  
To dig dig dig dig dig dig dig is what we really like to do  
It ain't no trick to get rich quick  
If you dig dig dig with a shovel or a pick  
In a mine! In a mine! In a mine! In a mine!  
Where a million diamonds shine!  

We dig dig dig dig dig dig dig from early morn till night  
We dig dig dig dig dig dig dig up everything in sight  
We dig up diamonds by the score  
A thousand rubies, sometimes more  
But we don't know what we dig 'em for  
We dig dig dig a-dig dig  

Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho  
Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho  
Heigh-ho  

Chorus  
Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho  
It's home from work we go  
(Whistle)  

Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho  

(Chorus)  

Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho  
(Whistle)  

Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho  
Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho  
Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho  
Heigh-ho hum  

(Chorus three times)  

Heigh-ho (until fade)
